# ToonTanks

A simple Arcade-styled Tank game made with UE4.26.2, part of the Unreal 4.22 C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games course which can be found on GameDev.tv.

The game features simple but refined mechanics, game rules and a full game loop with win and lose conditions. The playable character is a Toon Tank and the objective is to take out all the enemy turrets around the level.

This game has been made to gain a better understanding of class inheritance, sharing logic between both player controlled and AI controlled Pawns, implementing components and effects to bring the game to life.
